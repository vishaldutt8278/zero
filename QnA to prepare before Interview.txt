SQL:

#Full Outer Join vs Cross join
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

A cross join is a type of join that returns the Cartesian product of rows from the tables in the join. In other words, it combines each row from the first table with each row from the second table

#Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

#Left outer join vs left join\
syntax - SELECT OrderNumber, TotalAmount, FirstName, LastName, City, Country
  FROM Customer C 
  LEFT JOIN [Order] O ON O.CustomerId = C.Id
 ORDER BY TotalAmount

A LEFT JOIN performs a join starting with the left table.

Then, any matching records from the right table will be included.

Rows without a match will have NULL column values.


#inner join
matching rows( matching subset)
We can also write JOIN instead of INNER JOIN. JOIN is same as INNER JOIN.

#union and union all
The only difference between Union and Union All is that Union extracts the rows that are being specified in the query while Union All extracts all the rows including the duplicates (repeated values) from both the queries
If you know that all the records returned are unique from your union, use UNION ALL instead, it gives faster results.

#how to create an empty table from an existing table:
CREATE TABLE new_table
  AS (SELECT *
      FROM old_table WHERE 1=2);


#sequence of  execution of query in sql
1. FROM and JOINs
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. DISTINCT
7. ORDER BY
8. LIMIT / OFFSET


#where vs having
The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause cannot be used with aggregates, but the having clause can.

#Difference between order by and group by
The ORDER BY clause is applicable when we want to get the data obtained by a query in the sorting order
the GROUP BY clause is applicable when we want to use aggregate functions to more than one set of rows.

SELECT D_state, avg(D_salary) AS salary  
FROM developers  
GROUP BY D_state  
ORDER BY D_state DESC; 
This query initially formed an intermediate result that has grouped the state. Next, the AVG function is performed on each group of states, then sort the result in descending order.

#aggregate functions
SUM, MAX, MIN, COUNT and AVERAGE
Aggregators are very often used in conjunction with Grouping functions in order to summarize the data

SELECT ID,
Name,
sum(p.ownershippercentage) AS onwership_percentage
FROM Customer GROUP BY ID, Name

SELECT ID, 
Name,
ProductID,
OwnershipPercentage,
sum(OwnershipPercentage) over(partition by ID) as total_ownership_percentage
FROM Customer c


#transpose function
using decode:
select id,
max(decode(t.type, '1', t.contacttext))Phone,
max(decode(t.type, '2', t.contacttext))Fax,
max(decode(t.type, '3', t.contacttext))mob,
max(decode(t.type, '4', t.contacttext))Email
from
(select id, contacttext, type from customer
where id =1)t
group by id

using pivot:
SELECT * FROM 
  ( 
    SELECT id, contacttext, type 
    FROM customer 
    WHERE id = 1
  )
  PIVOT ( 
    min(contacttext)
    FOR type in (1 Phone, 2 Fax, 3 Mobile, 4 Email));


Pivot operator converts the rows data of the table into the column data. The Unpivot operator does the opposite that is it transform the column based data into rows.


#Managers of employeez
select a.ename as manager  , b.ename as employee
from emp a, emp b
where a.empno= b.mgr

#Employees earning more than managers

select a.ename as manager  , b.ename as employee ,a.sal as mgr_sal,
b.sal as emp_sal

from emp a, emp b
where a.empno= b.mgr
